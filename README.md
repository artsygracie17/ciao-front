# ciao-front

This is the front-end web interface of Ciao! written by Gracie Liu-Fang, using the prototype of the Ciao! mobile app as a reference. 

The Ciao! logo is designed by Neel Nayak, and the images I used are makeshift and will be replaced. 

Any use of this code must be credited back to Gracie Liu-Fang.
